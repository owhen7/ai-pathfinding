# ai-pathfinding
We are programming the artificial intelligence of "An agent in a gridworld [who] has to move from its current cell to the given cell of a non-moving target, where the gridworld is not fully known. They are discretizations of terrain into square cells that are either blocked or unblocked."

  Basically, We are programming the AI of a robot inside a digital maze that has to reach a goal efficiently.
